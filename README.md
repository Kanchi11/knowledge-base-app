## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Decision 1: IndexedDB (Client-Side Storage)

**Choice:** Browser's IndexedDB instead of backend database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)

**Rationale:**
- ✅ **Zero infrastructure** - No database server, Docker, or migrations needed
- ✅ **Instant setup** - Ready in 5 minutes vs 2-3 hours
- ✅ **Fast retrieval** - No network latency (~50ms vs ~200ms)
- ✅ **Privacy-first** - Data never leaves user's device
- ✅ **100MB capacity** - Sufficient for text-based documents
- ✅ **Persistent** - Survives browser restarts

**Trade-off:** 
- ❌ Single-user only (no collaboration)
- ❌ Not synced across devices
- ❌ Limited to ~100MB storage

**Production Alternative:**
```javascript
Current: IndexedDB (browser storage)
Production: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM

Benefits of PostgreSQL:
- Unlimited storage
- Multi-user support
- Cross-device sync
- Advanced queries
- ACID transactions
- Backup/restore capabilities

Migration Path:
1. Set up PostgreSQL database
2. Design schema with Prisma
3. Create API endpoints (CRUD)
4. Implement user authentication
5. Add document ownership/sharing
```

---

### Decision 2: Gemini 2.0 Flash (LLM Provider)

**Choice:** Google Gemini 2.0 Flash instead of GPT-4, Claude, or open-source models

**Comparison:**

| Feature | Gemini 2.0 Flash ✅ | GPT-4 | Claude 3.5 | Llama 3 |
|---------|-------------------|--------|------------|---------|
| **Cost** | Free (60/min) | $0.03/1K tokens | $0.015/1K tokens | Free (self-hosted) |
| **Speed** | 2-4 seconds | 5-10 seconds | 3-6 seconds | Variable |
| **Context** | 1M tokens | 128K tokens | 200K tokens | 128K tokens |
| **Quality** | Excellent | Best | Excellent | Good |
| **Setup** | API key only | API key + payment | API key + payment | Infrastructure |

**Why Gemini Wins for This Assessment:**
- ✅ **Free tier** - Perfect for prototypes and demos
- ✅ **Fast responses** - 2-4 second average (user-friendly)
- ✅ **Massive context** - Can send 20+ documents at once
- ✅ **Latest technology** - Shows I use cutting-edge tools
- ✅ **Good instruction following** - Returns structured responses consistently

**Production Consideration:**
```javascript
Current: Gemini 2.0 Flash (free tier)

Production Decision Tree:
┌─ Need best reasoning? → Use GPT-4
├─ Need cost optimization? → Use Gemini Pro
├─ Need long conversations? → Use Claude 3.5
└─ Need self-hosted? → Use Llama 3 + vLLM

For most use cases: Gemini remains excellent choice
```

---

### Decision 3: Client-Side File Processing

**Choice:** Extract text from PDFs/DOCX in browser (PDF.js, Mammoth.js)

**Rationale:**
- ✅ **No backend complexity** - No file upload handling, storage, cleanup
- ✅ **Instant feedback** - Users see progress immediately
- ✅ **Privacy-preserving** - Files never leave user's device
- ✅ **Reduces server load** - Processing happens on client
- ✅ **No storage costs** - No S3 or file server needed

**Trade-off:**
- ❌ Limited to browser capabilities (no OCR for scanned PDFs)
- ❌ Processing depends on user's device performance
- ❌ Limited to 10MB files (browser memory constraints)

**Production Upgrade:**
```javascript
Current: Client-side processing (PDF.js, Mammoth.js)

Production: Hybrid approach
┌─ Small files (<5MB) → Process in browser
└─ Large files (>5MB) → Process on server

Server-side benefits:
- OCR for scanned PDFs (Tesseract.js)
- Image extraction and analysis
- Support for 100MB+ files
- Better error handling
- Consistent processing speed

Implementation:
1. Check file size in frontend
2. If small → process locally
3. If large → upload to server
4. Server processes and returns text
5. Cache processed results
```

---

### Decision 4: No Vector Search / RAG

**Choice:** Send all documents to Gemini instead of implementing vector search

**Rationale:**
- ✅ **Simplest approach** - No embeddings, no vector DB
- ✅ **Fast to implement** - Saved 4-6 hours of development
- ✅ **Works great for <20 docs** - Gemini's 1M context handles it
- ✅ **No infrastructure** - No Pinecone, Weaviate, or Qdrant setup

**Trade-off:**
- ❌ Not scalable beyond ~20 documents
- ❌ Slower than vector search at scale
- ❌ Higher API costs for large corpora

**Production Upgrade: RAG Pipeline**

```javascript
Current Architecture:
User Query → Send ALL docs → Gemini → Answer
                ↓
     Works great for <20 documents

Production Architecture (RAG):
1. Document Ingestion:
   Document → Split into chunks → Generate embeddings
                                        ↓
                                 Store in Pinecone

2. Query Flow:
   User Query → Generate embedding → Similarity search
                                          ↓
                               Retrieve top-k chunks
                                          ↓
                               Send to Gemini → Answer

Benefits at Scale:
- Handle 1000s of documents ✅
- Sub-second retrieval ✅
- 90% lower API costs ✅
- Better accuracy ✅

Implementation Steps:
1. Choose embedding model (OpenAI Ada-002 or Cohere)
2. Set up vector database (Pinecone recommended)
3. Create chunking strategy (500-1000 tokens per chunk)
4. Index all documents with metadata
5. Implement similarity search
6. Update prompt with retrieved context
```

---

### Decision 5: React + Tailwind (Frontend Stack)

**Choice:** React with Tailwind CSS instead of Vue/Angular + other CSS solutions

**Why React:**
- ✅ **Job requirement** - Wand AI specifically asks for React experience
- ✅ **Industry standard** - 40%+ market share, huge ecosystem
- ✅ **Custom hooks** - Showcases advanced patterns (useDocumentStorage)
- ✅ **Component reusability** - Clean, maintainable code

**Why Tailwind:**
- ✅ **2x faster development** - No context switching to CSS files
- ✅ **Consistent design** - Predefined utility classes
- ✅ **Small bundle** - PurgeCSS removes unused styles
- ✅ **Responsive built-in** - Mobile-friendly by default

**Alternative Comparison:**
```
React + Tailwind (Chosen):
- Setup: 10 minutes
- Build speed: Fast
- Bundle size: ~50KB
- Development time: 4 hours for full UI

Vue + Tailwind:
- Setup: 10 minutes
- Build speed: Fast
- Bundle size: ~40KB
- Issue: Not in job requirements ❌

React + CSS Modules:
- Setup: 5 minutes
- Build speed: Medium
- Bundle size: ~30KB
- Issue: 2x slower development ❌

React + Styled Components:
- Setup: 10 minutes
- Build speed: Slower (runtime CSS)
- Bundle size: ~70KB
- Issue: Larger bundle, runtime overhead ❌
```
